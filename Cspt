Based on the pen testing report, the issue revolves around inconsistent or missing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in the application. CSP is a security feature that helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks. Here's how to resolve the issue and best practices for implementing a CSP.

Content Security Policy (CSP) Overview

CSP allows a web developer to control the resources (scripts, images, stylesheets, etc.) that a browser is allowed to load for the application. This helps to ensure that only trusted sources are loaded and executed in the browser, providing an additional layer of protection from certain attack vectors.

Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. Analyze and Identify the Gaps in CSP:

Missing Policy: As noted, the login page and other portions of the application lack CSP headers, and inconsistent headers were found across different parts of the application.

Incomplete Directives: The report highlights that even in the areas where CSP is implemented, the directives may not cover all necessary security aspects.



2. Define a Comprehensive CSP: A well-defined CSP should restrict the browser to load resources only from trusted origins and prevent the execution of inline or unsafe scripts.

Here is a sample CSP that could be used to secure the application:

Content-Security-Policy: 
default-src 'none'; 
script-src 'self'; 
connect-src 'self'; 
img-src 'self'; 
style-src 'self'; 
frame-ancestors 'none'; 
object-src 'none';

default-src 'none': Denies everything by default.

script-src 'self': Only allows scripts from the same origin.

connect-src 'self': Restricts XMLHttpRequests (AJAX), WebSocket connections, and EventSource to the same origin.

img-src 'self': Restricts images to be loaded only from the same origin.

style-src 'self': Restricts styles to be loaded from the same origin.

frame-ancestors 'none': Prevents the website from being embedded in frames, mitigating clickjacking attacks.

object-src 'none': Disables the use of <object>, <embed>, and <applet> tags, which are considered unsafe.



3. Avoid Unsafe Directives: The report warns against the use of insecure directives such as unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval, which allow inline scripts and unsafe dynamic code evaluation. These directives can expose the application to XSS attacks. Therefore, make sure not to use:

unsafe-inline: Allows inline JavaScript, which is a common vector for XSS.

unsafe-eval: Allows the use of eval() and similar JavaScript methods that can lead to security vulnerabilities.



4. Enforce CSP on All Pages: The login page was specifically mentioned as lacking a CSP header. Ensure that CSP is applied consistently across all pages of the application, including sensitive endpoints like /login.


5. Implement the CSP Header: In a Spring Boot application, you can implement the CSP header in one of two ways:

At the Application Level (Java/Spring Boot): You can add a filter or a response header in your Spring Security configuration to enforce the CSP.

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .headers()
            .contentSecurityPolicy("default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; object-src 'none'");
    }
}

At the Web Server Level (e.g., NGINX, Apache): If you are using a web server to serve the application, you can configure the CSP header in the server’s configuration.

For example, in NGINX:

add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; object-src 'none'";



6. Test and Fine-tune CSP: Implement the CSP in report-only mode first to gather reports about potential violations without blocking content. This allows you to fine-tune the policy without breaking functionality:

Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; ...

You can monitor the CSP violation reports in your browser’s developer tools or configure reporting endpoints to collect these violation reports.


7. Best Practices for Content Security Policy:

Limit the use of third-party resources: Restrict scripts and other resources from being loaded from third-party sources unless absolutely necessary.

Use nonce or hash-based whitelisting: If you need to allow inline scripts, use nonces or hashes to whitelist specific trusted scripts instead of using unsafe-inline.

Enable Subresource Integrity (SRI): When allowing external resources (such as scripts or styles from CDNs), enable SRI to ensure the resources haven’t been tampered with.

Monitor CSP Violations: Use Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only mode to test new rules and gather reports about potential violations without disrupting the user experience.




Conclusion

The identified issue of inconsistent or missing CSP headers represents a low-severity vulnerability (CVSS 1.7). However, by implementing a robust and consistent Content Security Policy across all endpoints, you can prevent various attacks such as XSS and clickjacking, greatly enhancing the security of the application. This document can be used to explain the resolution and best practices to the leads, providing both a technical solution and an overview of why CSP is crucial to securing web applications.





***************

Absolutely, providing a detailed explanation of the attacks that a proper Content Security Policy (CSP) can mitigate will help readers fully understand the importance of implementing CSP correctly. Here’s a breakdown of the potential attacks and what they mean, followed by how CSP helps mitigate them:

Understanding Potential Attacks Addressed by Content Security Policy

1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

What is XSS? Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. These scripts are executed in the victim's browser when they visit the compromised page. The goal of XSS attacks can vary, but common consequences include stealing user data (like cookies, session tokens), defacing the site, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.

How XSS Works:

The attacker finds a vulnerability in the web application that allows them to inject their own JavaScript into a webpage.

When a victim visits the compromised page, the browser executes the malicious script as if it were legitimate code from the site.

This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information (like authentication tokens), impersonate the user, or perform actions on their behalf.


Example: A user visits an e-commerce site. The attacker injects a malicious script that captures the user's session ID and sends it to the attacker’s server. The attacker can now impersonate the user and perform transactions on their behalf.

How CSP Prevents XSS: CSP helps prevent XSS by specifying where scripts are allowed to load from. By defining trusted sources (e.g., only allowing scripts from the same domain), CSP blocks scripts that come from untrusted or malicious sources. If properly configured, CSP can also block the execution of inline scripts, which are a common vector for XSS attacks.

2. Clickjacking

What is Clickjacking? Clickjacking is a technique where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, essentially hijacking their click. For example, an attacker might create a hidden frame over a legitimate button, making it appear like the user is interacting with a trusted site when, in fact, they are interacting with the attacker's malicious content.

How Clickjacking Works:

The attacker embeds a legitimate site (or portions of it) in a hidden <iframe> on their malicious page.

The user thinks they are clicking a harmless button or link on the legitimate site, but they are unknowingly performing actions that the attacker wants (such as transferring money or changing account settings).


Example: An attacker creates a webpage that looks like a harmless game. However, hidden in the background is a transparent iframe that contains the victim's online banking page. When the user clicks on the game, they are unknowingly approving a large money transfer.

How CSP Prevents Clickjacking: CSP can prevent clickjacking by using the frame-ancestors directive, which specifies which domains are allowed to embed the page in an iframe. By setting frame-ancestors 'none', you can block any site from embedding your page in an iframe, thus preventing clickjacking attempts.

3. Code Injection and Malicious Resource Loading

What is Code Injection? Code injection occurs when an attacker is able to insert and execute arbitrary code in the victim’s browser. This can include injecting malicious JavaScript that alters the behavior of the website or steals sensitive data.

What is Malicious Resource Loading? Malicious resource loading refers to an attacker manipulating the application to load resources (such as scripts, images, stylesheets) from untrusted or compromised sources. These external resources may contain malicious content that, when loaded, could infect the user’s browser or steal sensitive data.

How These Attacks Work:

Code Injection: The attacker finds a vulnerability in the web application that allows them to run their own code within the application’s context.

Malicious Resource Loading: The attacker manipulates the site’s configuration or intercepts traffic to make the application load malicious resources from an untrusted domain.


Example: An attacker injects a malicious script that changes the appearance of a website and tricks users into entering their personal details. Or, the attacker redirects the site’s resources (like JavaScript libraries) to their own server, where the resources have been modified to include malicious payloads.

How CSP Prevents Code Injection and Malicious Resource Loading: CSP allows developers to control which sources (domains) resources like scripts, images, and stylesheets can be loaded from. By whitelisting trusted domains and blocking others, CSP ensures that only trusted resources are used. It also helps prevent the execution of inline JavaScript or use of the eval() function, which are common ways to inject malicious code.


---

Key Directives in CSP to Mitigate Attacks

default-src: This directive specifies the default source for all types of content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) if more specific directives are not present. For example, default-src 'none'; blocks all resources unless explicitly allowed.

script-src: Defines which domains can serve JavaScript to the application. For example, script-src 'self'; ensures only scripts from the same origin as the page are allowed.

style-src: Controls which sources are allowed to serve CSS styles. For example, style-src 'self'; restricts styles to the same domain, preventing the injection of malicious stylesheets.

frame-ancestors: This directive controls who can embed your content in a frame. Setting frame-ancestors 'none'; prevents other sites from embedding your pages, protecting against clickjacking.

connect-src: Controls which domains the application is allowed to connect to (for example, via AJAX or WebSocket connections). Limiting this helps prevent data leaks or communication with untrusted origins.



---

Potential Impact of Not Implementing CSP

If a proper CSP is not implemented, the application is left vulnerable to several attack vectors:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks could lead to the theft of user data, session tokens, or even full account takeovers.

Clickjacking could lead users to perform unintended actions on their accounts or within the application.

Code Injection could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that alter the application’s behavior, possibly leading to data theft or further exploitation.

Malicious Resource Loading could allow attackers to manipulate resources (like scripts or stylesheets) loaded into the user’s browser, causing a wide range of potential damage.

Best Practices for Securing the Application Using CSP

To properly secure your application:

Start with a restrictive policy: Use default-src 'none' as the base, then gradually open up necessary sources using specific directives.

Minimize third-party resources: Limit the use of third-party scripts and styles as much as possible. If third-party resources are necessary, ensure they come from trusted and secure sources.

Disallow unsafe directives: Avoid using unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval, as these weaken the security provided by CSP.

Use Subresource Integrity (SRI): If external resources (such as from a CDN) must be used, ensure that Subresource Integrity is applied to verify the integrity of the loaded resources.

Monitor CSP reports: Enable CSP in report-only mode first to test your configuration. Monitor violation reports to identify and fix issues before enforcing the policy.

Conclusion

The inconsistent or missing CSP implementation noted in the pen testing report exposes the application to a range of attacks, including XSS, clickjacking, and malicious resource loading. Implementing a comprehensive and consistent CSP across all application pages, especially the login page, will significantly enhance the security of the application. This document serves as a detailed explanation of both the attack vectors and the recommended resolution, providing a clear path to mitigating these vulnerabilities.
