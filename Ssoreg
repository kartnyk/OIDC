  "audience": "string",
  "contactEmail": "string"
}



---

4. Workflows

1. Client Registration

Request Flow:

1. TV submits client registration details (e.g., clientName, destination, issuer) to DS using the Client Registration API.


2. DS generates a clientId and clientSecret.


3. DS stores the client details in the client_registry table.



Request Example:

{
  "clientName": "Banking App",
  "destination": "https://banking-app.com/sso/acs",
  "issuer": "https://idp.example.com",
  "recipient": "https://banking-app.com/sso/acs",
  "audience": "https://banking-app.com",
  "contactEmail": "admin@banking-app.com"
}

Response Example:

{
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "clientSecret": "xyz456"
}


2. SAML Metadata Update

Request Flow:

1. DS receives the SAML metadata (e.g., destination, issuer, recipient) from DP via a manual process.


2. DS updates the client’s record in the database using the SAML Metadata Update API.



Request Example:

{
  "destination": "https://banking-app.com/sso/acs",
  "issuer": "https://idp.example.com",
  "recipient": "https://banking-app.com/sso/acs",
  "audience": "https://banking-app.com"
}

Response Example:

{
  "message": "SAML details updated successfully"
}


3. Fetch Client Details

Request Flow:

1. TV requests client details using the Fetch Client Details API.


2. DS retrieves the record from the client_registry table and sends it back to TV.



Response Example:

{
  "clientId": "abc123",
  "clientName": "Banking App",
  "destination": "https://banking-app.com/sso/acs",
  "issuer": "https://idp.example.com",
  "recipient": "https://banking-app.com/sso/acs",
  "audience": "https://banking-app.com",
  "contactEmail": "admin@banking-app.com"
}

5. Key Design Principles

a. Database Design

Single table (client_registry) for simplicity.

Ensure columns like client_id and destination are indexed for fast lookups.


b. API Design

Follow RESTful principles:

Clear and meaningful endpoints.

Appropriate HTTP methods (POST for create/update, GET for fetch).


Input validation for all API fields (e.g., valid URLs, email formats).


c. Security

Encrypt clientSecret before storing in the database.

Use HTTPS for all API communications.


d. Scalability

Add pagination for the Fetch Client Details API if the number of clients grows.

Design APIs to allow future extensions (e.g., additional SAML attributes).



---

6. Future Enhancements

1. Admin Portal:

Build a UI for managing the SSO registry (create, update, delete clients).



2. Audit Trail:

Add a separate audit_logs table to record changes to client records.



3. Dynamic Configuration:

Add support for dynamic generation of SAML metadata for clients.

This solution is modular, scalable, and secure, while meeting all the provided requirements. Let me know if you’d like further refinements!

Thanks for clarifying! Here's how the solution evolves based on this additional context:

Revised Solution for the SAML Metadata API

SAML Provider URL Update

The purpose of the SAML Metadata API is to:

1. Allow DS to update the SAML Provider URL provided by DP for a specific client.


2. Store this URL in the client_registry table, so DS can use it during authentication for generating SAML assertions for the respective client.




Updated API Design

a. SAML Provider URL Update API

URL: /api/v1/sso/clients/{clientId}/saml-provider

Method: POST

Request Body:

{
  "samlProviderUrl": "string"
}

Response:

{
  "message": "SAML Provider URL updated successfully"
}


b. Usage

The API is invoked by DS after it receives the SAML Provider URL from DP (via manual or pipeline process).

This ensures the SAML Provider URL is stored and linked to the specific client in the database.



---

Revised Database Schema

Single Table: client_registry


---

Workflow for SAML Provider URL Update

1. SAML Provider URL Generation by DP

1. DS initiates a request to DP (manually or via pipeline) to generate a SAML Provider URL for a specific client.


2. DP generates the URL and returns it to DS.



2. SAML Provider URL Storage in DS

1. DS invokes the SAML Provider URL Update API with the URL provided by DP.


2. The API updates the saml_provider_url field in the client_registry table for the specific client.



3. Authentication Phase

1. When a user initiates SSO, DS retrieves the saml_provider_url for the specific client from the database.


2. DS uses this URL to request SAML generation from DP dynamically during the authentication flow.




---

Revised Fetch Client Details API

To ensure all necessary details are available for DS during authentication, the Fetch Client Details API now includes the saml_provider_url:

URL: /api/v1/sso/clients/{clientId}

Response:

{
  "clientId": "string",
  "clientName": "string",
  "destination": "string",
  "issuer": "string",
  "recipient": "string",
  "audience": "string",
  "samlProviderUrl": "string",
  "contactEmail": "string"
}



---

Key Points

1. SAML Provider URL:

This is critical for DS to dynamically generate SAML assertions via DP.

Each client has a unique URL stored in the saml_provider_url field.



2. Manual or Pipeline-Based Process:

The DS-to-DP communication for URL generation is done outside the current API scope.



3. Scalability:

The solution is designed to allow easy updates to the SAML Provider URL in case of reconfiguration or client-specific changes.

I will update the UML sequence diagram for the authentication flow to reflect the changes for Step 3 where DS uses the SAML Provider URL from the database to request the SAML assertion from DP. I’ll also provide the final solution, combining the registration and authentication flows.

Final Solution UML: Registration and Authentication

1. Registration UML

The registration process ensures that:

1. A client is registered by TV via DS.


2. DS stores client details, including the SAML Provider URL (received from DP).



Here’s the UML for the registration flow:

@startuml
participant "Client" as Client
participant "TV" as TV
participant "DS" as DS
participant "DP" as DP

== Client Registration ==
Client -> TV: Initiate Registration for Client
TV -> DS: Register Client
DS -> DS: Generate Client ID and Client Secret for Client

== DP Registration ==
DS -> DP: Request SAML URL
DP -> DP: Create SAML URL
DP -> DS: Return SAML URL

== Store Metadata and Credentials ==
DS -> DS: Store Client metadata\n(Entity ID, SAML URL, etc.)
DS -> DS: Store Client ID and Client Secret\nfor Client in the database

== Configure Credentials ==
DS -> TV: Send the registered credentials
alt [Configure Client Credentials]
    TV -> TV: Configure Client ID and Client Secret\nfor Client
else [Provide to Client]
    TV -> Client: Provide Client ID and Secret\nfor configuring in Client
end
@enduml


---

2. Authentication UML

The authentication process now ensures that DS uses the SAML Provider URL from the database to request the assertion from DP.

Here’s the revised UML for authentication:

@startuml
actor User
participant "TV" as TV
participant "DS" as DS
participant "DP" as DP
participant "Client" as Client

== User Login ==
User -> TV: Access TV Portal and Login
TV -> DS: Validate User Credentials
DS -> TV: Display SSO applications
User -> TV: Select Client TV Portal

== Client ID and Secret Validation ==
TV -> DS: Initiate SSO Login
DS -> DS: Validate client ID and client secret\nagainst database entry for Client
note right of DS: TV sends client ID and client secret\nfor authentication
alt [If Validation Fails]
    DS -> TV: Access Denied
    TV -> User: Access Denied
else [If Validation Succeeds]
    DS -> DP: Use SAML Provider URL for Client\n(Request SAML Assertion)
end

== DP Generates SAML Assertion ==
DP -> DP: Validate certificates
DP -> DS: Return signed SAML assertion for Client

== Redirect to SP with SAML Assertion ==
DS -> TV: Return signed SAML assertion for Client
TV -> Client: Access Client URL\nwith SAML Assertion

== Client Validates and Grants Access ==
Client -> Client: Verify SAML Assertion\n(Signature, Audience, Issuer, Conditions, Recipient)
Client -> User: Grant Access to Client
@enduml
